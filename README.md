This project for Suncoast Developer's Guild utilizes React to implement the game Blackjack. It posed challenges to understand asynchronous programming as frequently state would need to be set before other actions were performed on the deck or dealer/player hand states when functions would pass cards between the arrays. It also posed challenges because immutability issues with the state. While passing objects between arrays can easily be accomplished in vanilla javascript, states in react are immutable. The states cannot be changed by simple array functions without creating temporary updated states which are set after cards are passed between arrays. I am happy with this implementation of blackjack and shows my understanding of the complexities of state management in react, the concept of state immutability and asynchronous programming.
